## FractalEncryption
This application uses a Mandlebrot to encrypt your data! Just specify how deep you want to go and the application will try finding an interesting spot to generate your ecryption key. You may also save an image of the place where the encryption took place!

# How to Use: 
1. Download the files. 
2. Place the file you would like to encrypt in FractalEncryption\FractalEncryption. (before debug) 
3. Run the exe in the debug. 
4. Follow the Command line interface 

# V2 Update:
In the previous version of this software, the encryption was reliable at encrypting your data so long as your depth was greater than 10. This since has been fixed and any value greater than 2 should be reliable. Further testing to prove this is still required.
