# FractalEncryption
This application uses a Mandlebrot to encrypt your data! Just specify how deep you want to go and the application will try finding an interesting spot to generate your ecryption key. You may also save an image of the place where the encryption took place!

The program is usable but has yet to be tested extensively, please check back or inquire for real world use.
